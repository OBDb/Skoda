## About Škoda

Škoda Auto is a Czech automobile manufacturer founded in 1895, making it one of the world's oldest car manufacturers. Originally established as Laurin & Klement, the company was acquired by Škoda Works in 1925 and later became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group in 2000.

## Generations

### Early Years (1895-1945)

Founded as Laurin & Klement by Václav Laurin and Václav Klement, the company initially produced bicycles before moving to motorcycles in 1899 and automobiles in 1905. Their first car, the Voiturette A, established them as a reliable automobile producer in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After being acquired by Škoda Works in 1925, the company expanded its vehicle lineup but faced significant challenges during World War II.

### Communist Era (1945-1989)

Following World War II and the nationalization under communist rule, Škoda operated as a state-owned enterprise. During this period, the company produced several notable models like the Škoda 440/445 (Octavia), Škoda 1000 MB, and the Škoda 105/120/125 series. These vehicles were known for their reliability and practicality, though they often lagged behind Western automotive technology due to limited resources and innovation under the communist regime.

### Volkswagen Era (1990-Present)

After the Velvet Revolution and the fall of communism, Škoda became part of the Volkswagen Group in 1991, with Volkswagen taking full ownership in 2000. This partnership transformed Škoda from a regional brand to a global competitor with significant improvements in design, technology, and quality. Key models from this era include the modern Octavia, Fabia, Superb, and a growing SUV lineup including the Kodiaq and Karoq. Škoda has positioned itself as a value brand within the Volkswagen Group, offering comparable technology and features at competitive price points.

### Electrification Era (2019-Present)

Škoda entered the electrification era with the introduction of the Citigo-e iV and the ENYAQ iV, its first purpose-built electric vehicle based on Volkswagen's MEB platform. The company's "Strategy 2025" focuses on e-mobility and digital solutions, with plans to introduce several more all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid variants across its lineup.
